# Competitive Programming Algorithms and Techniques

Competitive programming (CP) encompasses a wide range of algorithms and techniques, each tailored to solve specific types of problems efficiently. Here’s a categorized overview of commonly used algorithms and techniques in CP:

## Pointer-Based Techniques

### Two Pointers

### Three Pointers
Typically used in problems involving multiple sorted arrays or partitioning problems.

### Sliding Window
Effective for solving problems related to subarrays or substrings (e.g., finding the maximum sum of subarray of size k, or the smallest subarray with a given sum).

## Greedy Algorithms
- Coin change problem (min number of coins).

- Huffman encoding.
- Fractional knapsack.
- Optimal merges (merge intervals).

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
- **Knapsack Variants**: 0/1, fractional, unbounded.
- **Subsequence/Subarray Problems**: Longest Increasing Subsequence, Longest Common Subsequence, Maximum Subarray Sum.
- **Matrix DP**: Problems like grid traversal, pathfinding, or matrix chain multiplication.
- **Bitmask DP**: Used for problems with state representation via bits (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem).
- **DP with Optimizations**: Divide and Conquer Optimization, Slope Optimization.
